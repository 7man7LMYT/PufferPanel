### A Word of Warning
While we endeavour to ensure that all code we push is secure, we can not promise that something may have been missed. Due to the open-source nature of PufferPanel it is possible for others to see the code and look for holes. We encourage anyone who finds a hole to immediately report it to us so we can do everything in our power to fix it.

# Special Thanks
* **[GSD](https://github.com/gametainers/gsd)** - Special thanks to Gametainers for creating and licensing GSD for use by PufferPanel. This is the core software daemon that we use to control server actions and quickly display data.
* **[FontAwesome.io](http://fontawesome.io)** — Mad props to the people who created this wonderful open-source icon-set that we take advantage of in PufferPanel.
* **[puffrfish](https://github.com/puffrfish)** — A very special thank you to puffrfish who had the idea almost three years ago to create PufferPanel for a hosting buisness. Without his reassurance, ideas, and determination this panel never would have made it off the ground and gotten to the point it has made it.
