# PufferPanel #
PufferPanel is a web-based game server management panel. PufferPanel allows you to manage and provision your game servers from a central location. Featuring an easy to use interface, simple installation, and modular architecture, PufferPanel is well suited to both single users and big networks alike.

## Open Source ##
PufferPanel is an open source project made possible by the contributions from our community. We sincerely appreciate each and every one of our users and always take them into consideration with everything that we do.

## What's different in v1.0.0 ##
We have decided to do an entire rewrite of the panel in order meet the needs of our users. This codebase will be more thought out and designed for the modularity required for adding additional game types and perhaps our most requested feature, an API. We are developing this version alongside our new daemon, pufferd, which will further increase the stability of the panel.

We will also be switching to a more appropriate versioning system, in which it will go {major}.{minor}.{patch} in an attempt to clean up how releases and updates go. The versioning for pufferd is undecided yet and will remain so until we have started enough work on 1.0.0 to decide how it will progress.

# Installing #
This version of the panel is currently in development and is not supported for installations yet. Please check back soon for more information!
