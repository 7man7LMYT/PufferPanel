#What is PufferPanel?
PufferPanel is a web-based Game Server Management System. PufferPanel allows you to manage multiple different game servers all from one central location. You can give other users their own servers or allow them access to your servers. You can find pictures of our interfaces in our [General User Feature Tour](http://www.pufferpanel.com/docs/general-user-feature-tour) or in our [Administrative Feature Tour](http://www.pufferpanel.com/docs/administrative-feature-tour).

#Open Source
PufferPanel has been and will always be committed to being free and open-source software. All of our projects are available on our GitHub Account and we welcome any user to submit ideas or code.

#Why Create PufferPanel
We set out to create PufferPanel to fill a hole in the Game Server industry. There are very few free and open-source game management panels out there, and we wanted to be the best. There are many users who simply cannot afford to shell out money on expensive management panels just to run a few personal servers, or want to use a system that restricts them from making modifications to suit their needs. PufferPanel changes all of this by providing a simple interface that can support multiple game types and keeps things simple and non-bloated.

#Why Use PufferPanel
PufferPanel offers you a no-hassle solution for managing your game servers at both a personal and a commercial level. By keeping all of our code open-source we allow anyone to submit ideas and features directly to the panel. In addition, you can browse through everything and submit bug reports and fixes as you find and patch them without having to wait on someone else to fix and release a new version.

Best of all? It's free.

# Installing
