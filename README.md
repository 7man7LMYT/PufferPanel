### A Word of Warning
**PufferPanel has not been throughly tested for security holes**. While we endeavour to ensure that all code we push is secure, we can not promise that something may have been missed. Due to the open-source nature of PufferPanel it is possible for others to see the code and look for holes. We encourage anyone who finds a hole to immediately report it to us so we can do everything in our power to fix it.

Please do not run PufferPanel on a live environment at this stage in its development. *We can not be held responsible for the potential loss, modification, or leaking of any client data, files, or other information.*

# Development Support
Support for PufferPanel comes from [Fishbans](http://fishbans.com) and **OSTKCabal** who have graciously provided us with development servers.

# Special Thanks
* **[GSD](https://github.com/gametainers/gsd)** - Special thanks to Gametainers for creating and licensing GSD for use by PufferPanel. This is the core software daemon that we use to control server actions and quickly display data. (v0.5.5-beta and above)
* **[xPaw](http://xpaw.ru)** — A special thanks to xPaw for allowing PufferPanel to use the [Minecraft Query](https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query) class that he developed. This code allows us to access server information such as version, players online, and more directly from the panel without any additional configuration needed on your end. (v0.5.0.1-beta and below)
* **[FontAwesome.io](http://fontawesome.io)** — Mad props to the people who created this wonderful open-source icon-set that we take advantage of in PufferPanel.
* **[puffrfish](https://github.com/puffrfish)** — A very special thank you to puffrfish who had the idea almost two years ago to create PufferPanel for a hosting buisness. Without his reassurance, ideas, and determination this panel never would have made it off the ground and gotten to the point it has made it.

# Additional Thanks
An additional shout-out to the folks below who have provided countless hours of development help, suggestions, and motivation.
