What is PufferPanel
-------------------
PufferPanel is a new game management panel built from the ground up to be flexible, secure, and allow for hosts to customize the panel to their own specific needs. Built on an open-source philosophy, PufferPanel can be edited by anyone without restrictions, and you can even build your own version of the panel that functions as you want it to.
